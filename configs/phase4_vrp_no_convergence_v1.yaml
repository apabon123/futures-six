# Phase 4 Research: VRP Meta-Sleeve WITHOUT Convergence
#
# Hypothesis: VRP-Convergence is a net-negative belief component
#             and should be removed from the VRP Meta-Sleeve.
#
# Baseline: phase4_vrp_baseline_v1 (Sharpe 0.469)
#   - VRP-Core: 30% weight, 79.5% contribution, Sharpe 0.405
#   - VRP-Convergence: 10% weight, -2.3% contribution, Sharpe -0.253 (NEGATIVE)
#   - VRP-Alt: 60% weight, 22.8% contribution, Sharpe 0.926
#
# Variant: Remove VRP-Convergence, renormalize weights
#   - VRP-Core: 30 / 90 = 33.3%
#   - VRP-Alt: 60 / 90 = 66.7%
#
# Evaluation: Post-Construction only
# Success Criterion: Sharpe improvement (e.g. 0.52-0.55+), no tail deterioration

# This config is for documentation only - actual evaluation uses Phase-1 timeseries
