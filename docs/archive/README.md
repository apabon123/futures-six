# Archive

This folder contains historical and completed phase documentation.

## Structure

- **`phases/`** - Completed phase documentation (Phase 1C, Carry phase run/audit memos, etc.)
  - Phase 1C was the Risk Targeting + Allocator Integration phase
  - Carry phase memos (e.g. `carry_phase0_run_memo.md`, `carry_phase1_run_memo.md`, `equity_carry_forensic_memo.md`) document run results and audits
  - These documents are kept for historical reference but are superseded by current SOTs

- **`RT_BUG_FOUND.md`** - Historical bug documentation (kept for reference)

## Note

These documents are archived for historical reference. For current authoritative documentation, see `../SOTs/`.
