# Documentation Index

All project documentation lives in this `docs/` directory so it stays easy to discover and maintain. Key references:

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` – Cross-Sectional Momentum implementation recap and artifacts
- `CROSS_SECTIONAL_MOMENTUM.md` – Full design document, API details, and usage examples for the cross-sectional strategy
- `TSMOM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` – Time-Series Momentum strategy reference
- `MACRO_REGIME_FILTER.md` – MacroRegimeFilter design, configuration, and integration guide

Additional resources:

- `../README.md` – High-level overview, quick start, and component inventory
- `../examples/` – Runnable demos (`demo_macro_regime.py`)
- `../reports/` – Generated backtest outputs when diagnostics are run

When adding new components, drop their docs here and update this index so navigating the architecture remains straightforward.
