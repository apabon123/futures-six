Status: PARKED
Reason: Phase-0 economic failure (hard fail; not borderline).
Sharpe: -0.5846
CAGR: -34.31%
MaxDD: -96.78%
HitRate: 6.05%
Signal Distribution: 15.7% active (non-degenerate)

Notes:
- Implementation and data diagnostics confirm correct behavior.
- Calendar-richness (VX1 > VX2) does not map to profitable outright VX1 short.
- VX term structure is usually in backwardation (VX1 < VX2), so contango signal only triggers in small subset of regimes (~15.7% active).
- Even when contango exists, simple directional short is not the right expression of "calendar carry."
- Results (CAGR -34%, MaxDD -97%, hit rate ~6%) indicate crisis convexity + bad timing, not "no carry exists."
- Wrong instrument / wrong payoff: curve relationships are better treated as features/regime inputs or spread trades, not outright VX1 directionality.
- Sleeve will not progress to Phase-1.

Revisit Conditions:
- Reframe as calendar-spread trade rather than directional VX1 exposure.
- Consider using front-spread as a feature/regime input rather than a directional sleeve.
- Potential integration into spread-based VRP research.
