# Phase-0: VRP-Convexity Threshold Signal Test (FAILED - PARKED)
# Status: PARKED - Phase-0 economic failure (hard fail; not borderline)

# Phase-0 Results:
# Sharpe: -0.1288 (FAIL - hard fail, not borderline)
# CAGR: -35.35%
# MaxDD: -97.73% (catastrophic)
# Signal: 52.4% active (non-degenerate)

# Rationale: Simple threshold rule (short VX1 when VVIX > 100) does not produce positive economic edge.
