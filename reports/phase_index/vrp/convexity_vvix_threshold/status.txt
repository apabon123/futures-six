Status: PARKED
Reason: Phase-0 economic failure (hard fail; not borderline).
Sharpe: -0.1288
CAGR: -35.35%
MaxDD: -97.73%
HitRate: 21.23%
Signal Distribution: 52.4% active (non-degenerate)

Notes:
- Implementation and data diagnostics confirm correct behavior.
- VVIX data loader works correctly (1467 rows, 2020-01-02 to 2025-10-31).
- Simple threshold rule (short VX1 when VVIX > 100) does not produce positive economic edge.
- Negative Sharpe (-0.1288) plus catastrophic MaxDD (-97.73%) indicates hard fail, not an "engineer it in Phase-1" situation.
- Signal distribution is non-degenerate (52.4% active), but strategy fails economically.
- Sleeve will not progress to Phase-1.

Revisit Conditions:
- Reframe as conditioning feature rather than directional VX1 trade.
- Consider VVIX as regime filter or spread-style trade component.
- Potential integration into Crisis Meta-Sleeve or as volatility regime indicator.
- VVIX data infrastructure is now available for future research.
