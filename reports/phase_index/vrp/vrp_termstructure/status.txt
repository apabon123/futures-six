Status: PARKED
Reason: Phase-0 economic failure.
Sharpe: -0.63
CAGR: -52.4%
MaxDD: -98.9%
HitRate: 43.2%

Notes:
- Implementation and data diagnostics confirm correct behavior.
- The economic mapping of (VX2 - VX1 > 0.5) → short VX1 does not produce a positive edge.
- Losses occur in spike regimes where contango persists.
- Sleeve will not progress to Phase-1.

Revisit Conditions:
- Consider using term-structure slope as a regime filter rather than a directional VRP sleeve.
- Potential integration into Crisis Meta-Sleeve or calendar-spread-based research.
