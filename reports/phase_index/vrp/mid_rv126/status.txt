PARKED — Phase-0 hard fail (both variants)

Rationale:
The VRP-Mid (RV126) Phase-0 tested two variants (VX2, VX3) with signal: short VX when VIX > RV126, else flat.

Both variants failed Phase-0 criteria:
- VX2: Sharpe -0.1704, MaxDD -85.68% (catastrophic)
- VX3: Sharpe -0.1517, MaxDD -73.88% (least bad, but still negative Sharpe)

The simple directional expression of mid-horizon implied vs realized volatility (VIX - RV126) does not contain a tradable edge. VIX > RV126 occurs ~82% of the time, but shorting VX in these regimes is not profitable and exposes the strategy to crisis convexity risk.

This is not an engine in simple form. Revisit only as:
- Conditioning feature (regime input, not direct signal)
- Different instrument (VIX options, vol ETFs)
- Different expression (spread trade, not directional short)
- With macro filters or z-scoring (new Phase-0 specification)
