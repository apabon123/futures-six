# Phase-2: VRP-Alt Portfolio Integration → Core v7 Promotion
# Registered: 2025-12-13

Promotion: VRP-Alt → Core v7
Weight: 15%
Lifecycle: Phase-0 borderline → Phase-1 strong → Phase-2 inconclusive → scaling verification → PROMOTED

## Lifecycle Summary

Phase-0: Borderline pass
- Sharpe: +0.10 (borderline threshold)
- MaxDD: –94.25% (catastrophic, expected for raw short-vol signals)
- Economic edge confirmed but requires engineering

Phase-1: Strong pass
- Sharpe: 0.91
- MaxDD: –2.01%
- Volatility: ~2% (very low volatility sleeve)
- Engineering (z-scoring, vol targeting, short-only constraint) transformed sleeve

Phase-2: Inconclusive at 5% weight
- Portfolio Sharpe: +0.0024 vs baseline (inconclusive)
- MaxDD: +0.05% vs baseline (acceptable)
- Limited impact due to low sleeve volatility

Scaling Analysis (Mandatory Verification):
- Tested weights: 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15%
- Results: Monotonic Sharpe improvement, stable MaxDD, no crisis vulnerabilities
- Optimal weight: 15% (Sharpe: 0.5874, MaxDD increase: +0.15%)

## Promotion Decision

VRP-Alt promoted at 15% weight, forming Core v7.

Final Core v7 Composition:
- Trend: 60%
- CSMOM: 25%
- VRP-Core: 7.5%
- VRP-Convergence: 2.5%
- VRP-Alt: 15%

## Notes

This promotion required a non-standard lifecycle due to:
1. Borderline Phase-0 pass (catastrophic MaxDD expected for raw short-vol)
2. Strong Phase-1 engineering result (very stable, low-volatility sleeve)
3. Inconclusive Phase-2 at low weight (required scaling verification)
4. Successful scaling analysis (monotonic improvement, controlled MaxDD)

VRP-Alt is the canonical example of the "Borderline Phase-0 + Scaling Verification" promotion workflow.
