Status: PARKED
Reason: Borderline Phase-0 result (weak edge and catastrophic drawdown).

Phase-0 Metrics (2020-01-01 to 2025-10-31):
- Sharpe: 0.0235  (Phase-0 requires ≥ 0.10)
- CAGR: -17.40%
- MaxDD: -85.65%
- HitRate: 30.23%
- Short exposure: 74.5% of days (signal non-degenerate)

Notes:
- Data loading, signal calculation, and PnL mechanics match VRP-Core / VRP-Convergence.
- The simple rule roll_yield = (VX1 - VIX) / days_to_expiry > 0 → short VX1 does not deliver a sufficiently strong economic edge.
- This sleeve will not proceed to Phase-1 under the current specification.

Revisit Conditions:
- Consider a richer roll-down carry specification (e.g., multi-tenor basket, additional regime filters, or integration into a composite VRP signal).
- Any new specification should be treated as a fresh Phase-0 idea, with separate scripts and documentation.
