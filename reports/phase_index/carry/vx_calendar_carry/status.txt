# VX Calendar Carry Status
# Updated: 2025-12-17

## Promotion Decision

PROMOTED: vx2_vx1_short (canonical)
- Status: Integrated into Core v8 baseline (5% research weight)
- Rationale: Slightly stronger Phase-2 improvements (+0.0377 Sharpe vs +0.0333) and liquidity-favored
- Phase-2 Results: Sharpe +0.0377, MaxDD +1.02%, Vol -0.71%, correlation -0.0508

VALID: vx3_vx2_short (secondary PASS, non-default)
- Status: Phase-2 PASS (secondary), validated backup
- Rationale: Excellent diversification (correlation -0.0075); retained as ready alternative
- Phase-2 Results: Sharpe +0.0333, MaxDD +0.96%, Vol -0.69%, correlation -0.0075
- Note: Keep as fallback if/when trading reality forces a switch

## Frozen Rules

Going forward, VX Carry should only come up again for:
- Allocator design / production execution workflow differences for spreads
- Interaction with other carry sleeves
- Future architecture changes (e.g., when adding real execution simulation)

Otherwise: expression + direction are frozen (short spread carry capture).
